# Overview
CollabWrite is a real-time collaborative writing platform that enables multiple users to edit documents simultaneously. It solves the problem of remote collaboration by providing a seamless, real-time editing experience with conflict resolution and user presence indicators. The platform is designed for remote teams, students, and writers who need to collaborate on documents in real-time.

# Core Features

## 1. Real-Time Collaborative Editing
- **What it does**: Allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously with real-time updates
- **Why it's important**: Enables seamless collaboration without conflicts or data loss
- **How it works**:
  - Uses CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for conflict resolution
  - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
  - Character-level synchronization
  - Automatic conflict resolution

## 2. User Authentication
- **What it does**: Secure user registration and login system
- **Why it's important**: Ensures document security and user accountability
- **How it works**:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Secure password hashing
  - Session management
  - Protected routes and endpoints

## 3. Document Management
- **What it does**: Create, view, and manage documents
- **Why it's important**: Provides basic document organization and access control
- **How it works**:
  - CRUD operations for documents
  - Document listing and filtering
  - Basic document metadata (title, creation date, last modified)
  - User-specific document access

## 4. User Presence
- **What it does**: Shows active users and their cursor positions
- **Why it's important**: Enhances collaboration awareness
- **How it works**:
  - Real-time user presence tracking
  - Cursor position synchronization
  - User color coding
  - Active user list

   - WebSocket client
   - Basic UI components

## Data Models
1. **User**
   - id: UUID
   - username: String
   - email: String
   - password_hash: String

2. **Document**
   - id: UUID
   - title: String
   - content: CRDT structure
   - created_at: DateTime
   - updated_at: DateTime
   - owner_id: UUID

3. **DocumentAccess**
   - document_id: UUID
   - user_id: UUID
   - access_level: Enum

## APIs and Integrations
1. **REST APIs**
   - /auth (login, register)
   - /documents (CRUD operations)
   - /users (user management)

2. **WebSocket APIs**
   - /ws/documents/{doc_id} (real-time updates)
   - /ws/presence (user presence)

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
1. **Real-time Synchronization**
   - Risk: Complex conflict resolution
   - Mitigation: Use CRDT for simpler implementation

2. **Performance**
   - Risk: Slow updates with many users
   - Mitigation: Optimize WebSocket communication

3. **Scalability**
   - Risk: System overload with many concurrent users
   - Mitigation: Implement proper connection management

## Resource Constraints
1. **Development Time**
   - Risk: Feature scope too large
   - Mitigation: Focus on MVP features first

2. **Technical Complexity**
   - Risk: Over-engineering
   - Mitigation: Keep implementation simple
